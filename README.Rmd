[**`toRvik`**](https://github.com/andreweatherman/toRvik) is an R package for working with and scraping men's college basketball data from [Barttorvik](https://barttorvik.com/). 
 
No subscription is required to access the data. The package includes functions for pulling player and team data, game results, advanced metric splits, play-by-play shooting, and more -- all returned in tibble format. As of version 1.0.2, `toRvik` ships with more than 20 functions.
   
## Package Installation
Install the released version of `toRvik` from CRAN:
```{r}
install.packages("toRvik")

```

## Package Highlights

## Basic Uses

All `toRvik` functions fall into one of five categories:

-   **Stat**, pulling and slicing player, team, and conference stats
-   **Tournament**, pulling raw and adjusted tournament
    performance
-   **Miscellaneous**

### Pull T-Rank ratings:

Calling `bart_ratings` will return the current T-Rank ranks and ratings.
```{r}
head(bart_ratings())
```

### Pull team statistics

```

Calling `bart_team_box` will return team box totals and per-game averages by game type. To filter by in-conference games, set type to 'conf.'
```{r}

```

### Pull player statistics

Calling `bart_player_season` will return detailed season-long player stats. To pull per-game averages, set stat to 'box.'
``` {r}
