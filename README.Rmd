[**`toRvik`**](https://github.com/andreweatherman/toRvik) is an R package for working with and scraping men's college basketball.

There are a lot of college basketball data out there, but most are difficult to pull and clean or they are behind a paywall. With `toRvik`, you have immediate access to some of the most detailed and extensive college basketball statistics publicly available -- all returned in tidy format with just a single line of code! Best of all, no subscription is required to access the data.\
\
Most of `toRvik`'s functions are powered by a dedicated Fast API framework -- delivering data at rapid speeds with dependable up-times.

As of version 1.0.3, the package includes nearly 30 functions for pulling player and team data, game results, advanced metric splits, play-by-play shooting, and more. Leveraging the same data and models as [Barttorvik](https://www.barttorvik.com), the package now offers game and tournament predictor functions, allowing you to simulate games between any pair of teams on any date at any venue back to the 2014-15 season. `toRvik` also offers extensive transfer histories for over 5,000 players back to the 2011-12 season and detailed player recruiting rankings for over 6,000 players back to 2007-08.

## Package Installation

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(toRvik)
```


Install the released version of `toRvik` from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("toRvik")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('devtools', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages('devtools')
}
devtools::install_github("andreweatherman/toRvik") 
```

## Package Highlights

-   Detailed game-by-game + season-long statistics by player and split
-   Extensive transfer + recruiting histories
-   Custom game and tournament predictions
-   Shooting splits + shares by team
-   Game box scores for all D-1 games
-   Team + conference four factors by split
-   Game-by-game four factors
-   NCAA committee-style team sheets
-   D-1 head coaching changes

## Basic Uses

All `toRvik` functions fall into one of six categories:

-   **Rating**, pulling and slicing T-Rank + four factor data
-   **Player**, pulling player data and histories
-   **Team**, pulling team statistics and histories
-   **Game**, pulling game-by-game data and schedules
-   **Tournament**, pulling raw and adjusted tournament performance
-   **Miscellaneous**

### Pull T-Rank ratings:

Calling `bart_ratings` will return the current T-Rank ranks and ratings.

```{r}
head(bart_ratings())
```

### Pull team statistics

Calling `bart_factors` will return four factor stats on a number of splits. To filter by home games, set venue to 'home.'

```{r}
head(bart_factors(location='H'))
```

Calling `bart_team_box` will return team box totals and per-game averages by game type. To find how Duke performed during the month of March:

```{r}
bart_team_box(team='Duke', split='month') |>
  dplyr::filter(month=='March')
```

### Pull player statistics

Calling `bart_player_season` will return detailed season-long player stats. To pull per-game averages for Duke players:

```{r}
head(bart_player_season(team='Duke', stat='box'))
```

Calling `bart_player_game` will return detailed game-by-game player stats. To pull advance splits by game for Duke players:

```{r}
head(bart_player_game(team='Duke', stat='advanced'))
```

### Pull transfer histories

Calling `transfer_portal` will return transfer histories with matching player IDs to join with other statistics. To find all players who transferred to Duke:

```{r}
head(transfer_portal(to='Duke'))
```

### Pull recruiting rankings

Calling `player_recruiting_rankings` will return extensive recruit histories with matching player IDs. To find all 5-star players who played high school basketball in North Carolina:

```{r}
head(player_recruiting_rankings(stars=5, state='NC'))
```

### Predict games and tournaments

Calling `bart_game_predictions` will returns expected points, possessions, and win percentage for a given game on a given date. To simulate North Carolina at Duke in mid-January:

```{r}
bart_game_prediction('Duke', 'North Carolina', '20220113', location = 'H')
```

Calling `bart_tournament_prediction` will simulate a single-elimination tournament between a group of teams on a given date. To simulate the 2022 Final Four 25 times:

```{r}
bart_tournament_prediction(teams = c('Duke', 'North Carolina', 'Kansas', 'Villanova'), '20220402', sims = 25, seed = 10)
```
